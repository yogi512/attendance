# This program is designed to work with the google meet attendance extension 'Google Meet Attendance List'

The link for the above extension - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-meet-attendance-li/appcnhiefcidclcdjeahgklghghihfok?

Make sure that the Auto Attendance feature is turned on in the extension if you want to mark attendance based on the time present.
The auto feature will generate attendance automatically after you end your meet
Else if you take attendance manually using the save attendance in the people columns of the Google meet ,
it will mark attendance based on presence alone 

# Things to do :

1.Save Format : 'Class_yyyy-mm-dd.csv'  eg.'AC_2021-01-01.csv' 
  - You should store the daily attendance list in the Data directory
  - Make sure the the 'data_dir' in line 11 of 'Mark_Attendance.py' points to the Data directory //  '.' refers to the current directory
2.You should store the class list for different subjects in which you wish to store the attendance in the directory which contains the python file 
3.Store Format for class list : 'Class.csv' eg.'AC.csv'
  - The 'Class' name must be same as the names stored in data directory
  - Eg. If attendance for today's class is stored as 'EC_2021-01-01.csv'
            then there must be a csv file that contains 
            the list of students with their Google Account Names stored as 'EC.csv'
            The attendance for everyday's class will be marked in the 'EC.csv' file headed by the date

4. We can have any number of classes 
  - 'EC.csv','AC.csv',etc. 
  - the daily attendence for these classes must be stored as 'EC_2021-01-01','AC_2021-01-01',etc. in the Data directory
5.Now We are good to go 
  - Execute the python file 'Mark_Attendance.py' to mark attendances


Note :

1.The files in Data folder are just some examples for daily attendance , you can delete them
2.Similarly the csv files are examples for class list with attendance marked , you can delete them too
3.The 'parser.ipynb' is also not necessary, you can delete it
4.We can change the amount of time present in order to be marked present by changing the 'threshold' value in line 82
  - 0.5*avg  means , present will be marked if anyone is present for atleast half of the class avg time

Precautions:

1.The Class list must contain their google accounts names which they use to join meet
2.The Class lists must be present 
3.The names of the daily attendance csv files must match with the class list csv file in terms of class name
